# HELLO VIEWERS!!!!!

This is my first project ever after stepping into the world of coding!!

This is a sample portfolio webpage themed **"Futurist"**. I divided the whole webpage into different sections while creating it, as follows:

## HEADER

This section contains links to different sections of the webpage, redirecting you to them.

## BODY/CONTAINER

This section welcomes the user to the website.
